# Coursera_TwitterSentiment
Scripts for analyzing Twitter feed using sentiment scores

Used within the following Coursera course: Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms, from the University of Washington, https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation

Note that you will have to enter your own Twitter API Code in twitterstream.py before proceeding. In addition, there is still a lot of refinement needed in:
- including unicode characters and non-alphanumeric ones,
- words parsing and separation, and 
- calculating sentiment beyond just words (but considering phrases and structures as well).
