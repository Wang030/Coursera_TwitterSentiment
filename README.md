# Coursera_TwitterSentiment
Scripts for analyzing Twitter feed using sentiment scores

Used within the following Coursera course: Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms, from the University of Washington, https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation

Note that you will have to enter your own Twitter API Code in twitterstream.py before proceeding. In addition, there is still a lot of work to be done in including unicode characters and non-alphanumeric ones, as well as parsing words separation.
